[00:38.23] They will discover you
[00:44.81] Drawing in the living room
[00:52.07] Time won't have altered you

[01:24.89] If they uncover you
[01:32.99] Proving all your theories

[01:53.29] 
[02:21.72] Laws of all gravity
[02:28.13] Dancing out in front of me
[02:36.38] Time won't have altered me
[02:49.38] 
[03:18.15] Regrets a little more
[03:24.74] With each step we take
[03:32.00] These steps to your doom
